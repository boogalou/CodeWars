// Do you know how to make a spiral? Let's test it!
// Classic definition: A spiral is a curve which emanates from a central point, getting progressively farther away as it revolves around the point.

// Your objective is to complete a function createSpiral(N) that receives an integer N and returns an NxN two-dimensional array with numbers 1 through NxN represented as a clockwise spiral.

// Return an empty array if N < 1 or N is not int / number

// Examples:

// N = 3 Output: [[1,2,3],[8,9,4],[7,6,5]]

// 1    2    3
// 8    9    4
// 7    6    5
